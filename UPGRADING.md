## Upcoming

**This release removes the need for `levelup` and `encoding-down`. This means that an `abstract-leveldown` compliant db is a complete solution that doesn't need to be wrapped. It has the same API as `level(up)` including encodings, promises and events. In addition, implementations can use typed arrays (Uint8Array) instead of Buffer if they want to. Consumers of an implementation can use both.**

For most folks an upgraded `abstract-leveldown` db can be a drop-in replacement for a `level(up)` db. Let's start this upgrade guide there: all methods have been enhanced and tuned to reach API parity with `levelup`.

### 1. API parity with `levelup`

#### 1.1. New: Promise support

All methods that take a callback now also support promises. They return a promise if no callback is provided, the same as `levelup`. Implementations that override public (non-underscored) methods _must_ do the same and any implementation _should_ do the same for additional methods if any.

#### 1.2. New: events & idempotent open

The prototype of `require('abstract-leveldown').AbstractLevelDOWN` now inherits from `require('events').EventEmitter`. Opening and closing is idempotent and safe, and emits the same events as `levelup` would (with the exception of the 'ready' alias that `levelup` has for the 'open' event - `abstract-leveldown` only emits 'open').

#### 1.3. New: deferred open

Deferred open is built-in. This means an `abstract-leveldown` instance opens itself a tick after its constructor returns. Any operations made until opening has completed are queued up in memory. When opening completes the operations are replayed. If opening has failed (and this is a new behavior compared to `levelup`) the operations will yield errors. The `abstract-leveldown` prototype has a new `defer()` method for an implementation to defer custom operations.

The initial `status` of an `abstract-leveldown` instance is now 'opening', and the previous `status` 'new' is gone.

Wrapping an `abstract-leveldown` instance with `deferred-leveldown` or `levelup` is no longer supported. It will either throw or exhibit undefined behavior.

#### 1.4. New: state checks

On any operation, `abstract-leveldown` now checks if it's open. If not, it will either throw an error (if the relevant API is synchronous) or asynchronously yield an error. For example:

```js
try {
  db.iterator()
} catch (err) {
  // Error: Database is not open
}
```

```js
try {
  await db.get('example')
} catch (err) {
  // Error: Database is not open
}
```

```js
db.get('example', function (err) {
  // Error: Database is not open
})
```

This may be a breaking change downstream because it changes error messages for implementations that had their own safety checks (which will now be ineffective because `abstract-leveldown` checks are performed first).

Implementations that have additional methods, like `leveldown` that has an `approximateSize()` method which is not part of the `abstract-leveldown` interface, should add or align their own safety checks for consistency. Like so:

```js
// For brevity this example does not implement promise support
LevelDOWN.prototype.approximateSize = function (start, end, callback) {
  if (this.status === 'opening') {
    this.defer(() => this.approximateSize(start, end, callback))
  } else if (this.status !== 'open') {
    this.nextTick(callback, new Error('Database is not open'))
  } else {
    // ..
  }
}
```

#### 1.5. New: chained batch length

The `AbstractChainedBatch` prototype has a new `length` property that, like a chained batch in `levelup`, returns the number of operations in the batch. Implementations should not have to make changes for this unless they monkey-patched public methods of `AbstractChainedBatch`.

### 2. New: encodings

All relevant methods including the `AbstractLevelDOWN` constructor now accept `keyEncoding` and `valueEncoding` options. Read operations now yield strings rather than buffers by default, to align with `level` and friends.

Both the public and private API of `abstract-leveldown` are encoding-aware. This means that private methods receive `keyEncoding` and `valueEncoding` options too, instead of `keyAsBuffer`, `valueAsBuffer` or `asBuffer`. Implementations don't need to perform encoding or decoding themselves. In fact they can do less: the `_serializeKey()` and `_serializeValue()` methods are also gone and implementations like `memdown` don't have to convert between strings and buffers.

For example: a call like `db.put(key, { x: 2 }, { valueEncoding: 'json' })` will encode the `{ x: 2 }` value and might forward it to the private API as `db._put(key, '{"x":2}', { valueEncoding: 'utf8' }, callback)`. Same for the key (omitted for brevity). The private API would previously receive `{ asBuffer: false }` options.

The keys, values and encoding options received by the private API depend on which encodings it supports. It must declare those via the manifest passed to the `AbstractLevelDOWN` constructor. See README for details. For example, an implementation might only support storing data as Uint8Arrays, known here as a "view":

```js
AbstractLevelDOWN({ encodings: { view: true } })
```

The JSON example above would then result in `db._put(key, value, { valueEncoding: 'view' })` where `value` is a Uint8Array containing JSON. Implementations can also declare support of multiple encodings; keys and values will then be encoded via the most optimal path.

Lastly:

- The `binary` encoding has been renamed to `buffer`, with `binary` as an alias
- The `utf8` encoding will always return a string. It previously did not touch Buffers. Now it will call `buffer.toString('utf8')` for consistency. Consumers can (selectively) use the `buffer` or `view` encoding to avoid this conversion.
- Unlike `encoding-down` and `level-codec`, the legacy and undocumented `encoding` option (as an alias for `valueEncoding`) is not supported
- The `AbstractIterator` constructor now requires an `options` argument
- The `AbstractIterator#_seek()` method got a new `options` argument
- Zero-length keys are now valid
- The `ascii`, `ucs2` and `utf16le` encodings are not supported.

### 3. Closing iterators is idempotent

The `iterator.end()` method has been renamed to `iterator.close()`, with `end()` being an alias for now. The term "close" makes it easier to differentiate between the iterator having reached its natural end (data-wise) versus closing it to cleanup resources.

Likewise, `_end()` has been renamed to `_close()` but without an alias. This method is no longer allowed to yield an error.

On `db.close()`, non-closed iterators are now automatically closed. This may be a breaking change but only if an implementation has (at its own risk) overridden the public `end()` method, because `close()` or `end()` is now an idempotent operation rather than yielding a `new Error('end() already called on iterator')`. If a `next()` is in progress, closing the iterator (or db) will wait for that.

The error messages `cannot call next() after end()` and `cannot call seek() after end()` have been replaced with `Iterator is not open`, and `cannot call next() before previous next() has completed` and `cannot call seek() before next() has completed` have been replaced with `Iterator is busy`.

The `next()` method no longer returns `this` (when a callback is provided).

### 4. Chained batch can be closed

Chained batch has a new method `close()` which is an idempotent operation and automatically called after `write()` (for backwards compatibility) or on `db.close()`. This to ensure batches can't be used after closing and reopening a db. If a `write()` is in progress, closing will wait for that. If `write()` is never called then `close()` must be.

These changes could be breaking for an implementation that has (at its own risk) overridden the public `write()` method. In addition, the error message `write() already called on this batch` has been replaced with `Batch is not open`.

### 5. Semi-private properties have been made private

The following properties and methods can no longer be accessed, as they've been removed or replaced with internal [symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol):

- `AbstractIterator#_nexting`
- `AbstractIterator#_ended`
- `AbstractChainedBatch#_written`
- `AbstractChainedBatch#_checkWritten()`
- `AbstractChainedBatch#_operations`
- `AbstractLevelDOWN#_setupIteratorOptions()`

### 6. Breaking changes to test suite

- Options to skip tests have been removed in favor of `db.supports`
- Support of `db.clear()` and `db.getMany()` is now mandatory. The default (slow) implementation of `_clear()` has been removed.
- The `setUp` and `tearDown` functions have been removed from the test suite and `suite.common()`.
- Added ability to access manifests via `testCommon.supports`, by lazily copying it from `testCommon.factory().supports`. This requires that the manifest does not change during the lifetime of a `db`.

Lastly, it's recommended to revisit any custom tests of an implementation. In particular if those tests relied upon the previously loose state checking of `abstract-leveldown`. For example, making a `db.put()` call before `db.open()`. Such a test now has a different meaning. The previous meaning can typically be restored by wrapping tests with `db.once('open', ...)` or `await db.open()` logic.

## 7.0.0

Legacy range options have been removed ([Level/community#86](https://github.com/Level/community/issues/86)). If you previously did:

```js
db.iterator({ start: 'a', end: 'z' })
```

An error would now be thrown and you must instead do:

```js
db.iterator({ gte: 'a', lte: 'z' })
```

This release also drops support of legacy runtime environments ([Level/community#98](https://github.com/Level/community/issues/98)):

- Node.js 6 and 8
- Internet Explorer 11
- Safari 9-11
- Stock Android browser (AOSP).

Lastly, and less likely to be a breaking change, the [`immediate`](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/immediate) browser shim for `process.nextTick()` has been replaced with the smaller [`queue-microtask`](https://github.com/feross/queue-microtask). In the future we might use `queueMicrotask` in Node.js too.

## 6.0.0

This release brings a major refactoring of the test suite, decouples `abstract-leveldown` from disk-based implementations and solves long-standing issues around serialization and type support. Because the changes are substantial, this guide has two sections:

1. **Changes to public API** - for consumers of any implementation.
2. **Changes to private API** - intended for implementors.

### Changes to public API

#### Nullish values are rejected

In addition to rejecting `null` and `undefined` as _keys_, `abstract-leveldown` now also rejects these types as _values_, due to preexisting significance in streams and iterators.

Before this, the behavior of these types depended on a large number of factors: `_serializeValue` and type support of the underlying storage, whether `get()`, `iterator()` or a stream was used to retrieve values, the `keys` and `asBuffer` options of `iterator()` and finally, which encoding was selected.

#### Range options are serialized

Previously, range options like `lt` were passed through as-is, unlike keys.

#### The rules for range options have been relaxed

Because `null`, `undefined`, zero-length strings and zero-length buffers are significant types in encodings like `bytewise` and `charwise`, they became valid as range options. In fact, any type is now valid. This means `db.iterator({ gt: undefined })` is not the same as `db.iterator({})`.

Furthermore, `abstract-leveldown` makes no assumptions about the meaning of these types. Range tests that assumed `null` meant "not defined" have been removed.

#### Zero-length array keys are rejected

Though this was already the case because `_checkKey` stringified its input before checking the length, that behavior has been replaced with an explicit `Array.isArray()` check and a new error message.

#### No longer assumes support of boolean and `NaN` keys

A test that asserted boolean and `NaN` keys were valid has been removed.

#### Browser support

IE10 has been dropped.

### Changes to private API

#### `location` was removed

`AbstractLevelDOWN` is no longer associated with a `location`. It's up to the implementation to handle it if it's required.

If your implementation has a `location` and you previously did:

```js
function YourDOWN (location) {
  AbstractLevelDOWN.call(this, location)
}
```

You must now do:

```js
function YourDOWN (location) {
  this.location = location
  AbstractLevelDOWN.call(this)
}
```

Be sure to include appropriate type checks. If you relied on the default `AbstractLevelDOWN` behavior that would be:

```js
if (typeof location !== 'string') {
  throw new Error('constructor requires a location string argument')
}
```

#### Abstract test suite has moved to a single entry point

Instead of including test files individually, you can and should include the test suite with one `require()` statement. If you previously did:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const testCommon = require('abstract-leveldown/testCommon')
const YourDOWN = require('.')

require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/get-test').all(YourDOWN, test, testCommon)
require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/put-test').all(YourDOWN, test, testCommon)

// etc
```

You must now do:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const suite = require('abstract-leveldown/test')
const YourDOWN = require('.')

suite({
  test: test,
  factory: function () {
    return new YourDOWN()
  }
})
```

The input to the test suite is a new form of `testCommon`. Should you need to reuse `testCommon` for your own (additional) tests, use the included utility to create a `testCommon` with defaults:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const suite = require('abstract-leveldown/test')
const YourDOWN = require('.')

const testCommon = suite.common({
  test: test,
  factory: function () {
    return new YourDOWN()
  }
})

suite(testCommon)
```

As part of removing `location`, the abstract tests no longer use `testCommon.location()`. Instead an implementation _must_ implement `factory()` which _must_ return a unique and isolated database instance. This allows implementations to pass options to their constructor.

The `testCommon.cleanup` method has been removed. Because `factory()` returns a unique database instance, cleanup should no longer be necessary. The `testCommon.lastLocation` method has also been removed as there is no remaining use of it in abstract tests.

Previously, implementations using the default `testCommon` had to include `rimraf` in their `devDependencies` and browser-based implementations had to exclude `rimraf` from browserify builds. This is no longer the case.

If your implementation is disk-based we recommend using [`tempy`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/tempy) (or similar) to create unique temporary directories. Together with `factory()` your setup could now look something like:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const tempy = require('tempy')
const suite = require('abstract-leveldown/test')
const YourDOWN = require('.')

suite({
  test: test,
  factory: function () {
    return new YourDOWN(tempy.directory())
  }
})
```

#### The `collectEntries` utility has moved

The `testCommon.collectEntries` method has moved to the npm package  `level-concat-iterator`. If your (additional) tests depend on `collectEntries` and you previously did:

```js
testCommon.collectEntries(iterator, function (err, entries) {})
```

You must now do:

```js
const concat = require('level-concat-iterator')
concat(iterator, function (err, entries) {})
```

#### Setup and teardown became noops

Because cleanup is no longer necessary, the `testCommon.setUp` and `testCommon.tearDown` methods are now noops by default. If you do need to perform (a)synchronous work before or after each test, `setUp` and `tearDown` can be overridden:

```js
suite({
  // ..
  setUp: function (t) {
    t.end()
  },
  tearDown: function (t) {
    t.end()
  }
})
```

#### Optional tests have been separated

If your implementation does not support snapshots or other optional features, the relevant tests may be skipped. For example:

```js
suite({
  // ..
  snapshots: false
})
```

Please see the [README](README.md) for a list of options. Note that some of these have replaced `process.browser` checks.

#### Iterator must have a `db` reference

The `db` argument of the `AbstractIterator` constructor became mandatory, as well as a public `db` property on the instance. Its existence is not new; the test suite now asserts that your implementation also has it.

#### Seeking became part of official API

If your implementation previously defined the public `iterator.seek(target)`, it must now define the private `iterator._seek(target)`. The new public API is equal to the reference implementation of `leveldown` except for two differences:

- The `target` argument is not type checked, this is up to the implementation.
- The `target` argument is passed through `db._serializeKey`.

Please see the [README](README.md) for details.

#### Chained batch has been refactored

- The default `_clear` method is no longer a noop; instead it clears the operations queued by `_put` and/or `_del`
- The `_write` method now takes an `options` object as its first argument
- The `db` argument of the `AbstractChainedBatch` constructor became mandatory, as well as a public `db` property on the instance, which was previously named `_db`.

#### Default `_serializeKey` and `_serializeValue` became identity functions

They return whatever is given. Previously they were opinionated and mostly geared towards string- and Buffer-based storages. Implementations that didn't already define their own serialization should now do so, according to the types that they support. Please refer to the [README](README.md) for recommended behavior.

## 5.0.0

Dropped support for node 4. No other breaking changes.

## 4.0.0

#### default `testCommon` parameter

The `testCommon` parameter will now default to `abstract-leveldown/testCommon.js`. You can omit this parameter, unless your implementation needs a custom version.

If your code today looks something like:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const testCommon = require('abstract-leveldown/testCommon')
const leveldown = require('./your-leveldown')
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/get-test')

abstract.all(leveldown, test, testCommon)
```

You can simplify it to:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const leveldown = require('./your-leveldown')
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/get-test')

abstract.all(leveldown, test)
```

#### `testBuffer` parameter removed

The `abstract/put-get-del-test.js` previously took a custom `testBuffer` parameter. After an [analysis](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown/pull/175#issuecomment-353867144) of various implementations we came to the conclusion that the parameter has no use.

If your implementation is using this abstract test, change from:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const testCommon = require('abstract-leveldown/testCommon')
const leveldown = require('./your-leveldown')
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const testBuffer = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'data/testdata.bin'))
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/put-get-del-test')

abstract.all(leveldown, test, testBuffer, testCommon)
```

to:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const testCommon = require('abstract-leveldown/testCommon')
const leveldown = require('./your-leveldown')
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/put-get-del-test')

abstract.all(leveldown, test, testCommon)
```

or if `testCommon` is also redundant, to:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const leveldown = require('./your-leveldown')
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/put-get-del-test')

abstract.all(leveldown, test)
```

#### `.approximateSize` method removed

The `.approximateSize` method has been removed from the public API. It is heavily related to `LevelDB` and more often than not, other stores lack the native primitives to implement this. If you did implement the internal `_approximateSize` method, that is now dead code. To preserve the method in your public API, rename it to `approximateSize` and also take care of the initialization code. Look to `leveldown` for inspiration.

Also, the corresponding abstract tests have been removed, so your implementation can no longer require `abstract/approximate-size-test`.

#### `._isBuffer` method removed

Because `Buffer` is available in all environments nowadays, there is no need for alternatives like typed arrays. It is preferred to use `Buffer` and `Buffer.isBuffer()` directly.

#### `isLevelDOWN` function removed

This was a legacy function.

#### `ranges-test.js` renamed

We have refactored a lot of the tests. Specifically the iterator tests were split in two and in that process we renamed `ranges-test.js` to `iterator-range-test.js`.

If your implementation is using these tests then change from:

```js
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/ranges-test')
```

to:

```js
const abstract = require('abstract-leveldown/abstract/iterator-range-test')
```

## 3.0.0

No changes to the API. New major version because support for node 0.12 was dropped.
